# Series: What Grows _Summer 2024 - Present_

<div class="horizontal">
<div>

A meditation on the concept of growth.

Cells grow.

Companies grow.

Animals, trees, fish, birds, they all grow.

_We_ grow.

Each piece explores how growth impacts us, how it feels to grow, and what it
means to be a growing, changing being.

This piece reinterprets growth as overgrowth, combining the visual of infinite

examines the clashing of artificial growth and natural growth, specifically as
it relates to noise pollution in our environment.
