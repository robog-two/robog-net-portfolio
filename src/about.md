They have a small keyring clipped into a belt loop, their right hand is in their pocket and their left hand is holding an umbrella with multicolored strawberries printed on it.

Behind the two dogs is a soccer ball, a small red ball, and a small yellow ball. Two armchairs and a third small orange ball are further back in the image.](/blog/media/dogs.jpeg)
